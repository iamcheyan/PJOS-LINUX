# 07 — Partition layout and A/B system updates

BaseOS uses seven GPT partitions and two rootfs slots. Updating writes the
inactive slot, verifies it, then changes partition 5 to select that slot.
Userdata and frontend storage retain their existing extents.

## 1. Boot contract

U-Boot loads the partition named `boot`; the kernel mounts partition number 5
as root. Its start address comes from GPT, allowing a slot switch without
changing the vendor bootloader or kernel. Partition names and order
must remain compatible with the vendor boot chain.

## 2. Layout

The normalized layout uses these LBAs; builds derive them from the prepared
source geometry and configured slot sizes.

| Entry | Name | Start LBA | Size/role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `special` | 73728 | 64 MiB vendor partition |
| 2 | `boot-resource` | 204800 | 32 MiB vendor FAT, with BaseOS bootlogo |
| 3 | `env` | 270336 | 16 MiB vendor environment |
| 4 | `boot` | 303104 | 64 MiB vendor Android boot image |
| 5 | `rootfs` | 434176 or 1482752 | Active 512 MiB slot |
| — | Inactive slot | 1482752 or 434176 | 512 MiB unallocated extent |
| 6 | `UDISK` | 2531328 | 128 MiB persistent `/data` |
| 7 | `primary` | 2793472 | FAT32 frontend storage, expanded on first boot |

Entry 8 is empty. `appfs` is omitted; `UDISK` and `primary` preserve their
vendor identities when present in the prepared input. The initial image is
2,926,592 sectors (1,498,415,104 bytes); compressed size varies with contents.

### Desktop visibility

All entries except `primary` carry attributes `0xC000000000000000`: hidden
(bit 62) and no drive letter (bit 63). `primary` remains Microsoft Basic Data
with attributes zero. This requests one Windows drive letter; verify actual
host behavior during hardware acceptance. macOS can still mount the vendor
FAT `boot-resource` volume because it does not honor those attributes.

## 3. Update payload

A `.bosupd` is an uncompressed ustar archive with `manifest` followed by
`rootfs.img.gz`. The manifest contains:

```text
format=baseos-update/1
target=<device-id>
version=<release-version>
build=<build-id>
slot-sectors=1048576
image-size=536870912
image-sha256=<sha256 of decompressed rootfs image>
```

The rootfs bytes come from the image built by `build-image.sh`. The manifest
hash verifies decompressed image integrity; payloads are not signed.
`build-all.sh` also prints download-file checksums for the release page.
The updater replaces rootfs only and leaves p2 artwork alone. A rootfs carries
the [one-time boot-file migration](12-kernel-gzip.md). On its first boot the new
system replaces the boot package and boot image, quiets boot0, starts the
frontend and confirms the trial. The next ordinary boot uses the new files. A/B
rollback does not cover those shared boot areas.

## 4. Selection and application

`baseos-update apply` runs after card mounting. It scans the active frontend
card first, then TF1's visible partition when that is a different volume.
USB-storage mode skips scanning, including manual apply/status invocations.

The first applicable payload in directory/glob order is selected. A payload
must match the target and slot geometry, be newer than the running version
(or the same version with a different build), and have no committed image hash
in `/data/update/history`. Selection does not jump directly to the highest
version. `baseos-update status` reports each candidate's eligibility.

Application proceeds as follows:

1. Validate the manifest and slot geometry.
2. Decompress into the inactive slot in chunks, updating progress as writes finish.
3. Read the slot back and verify its SHA-256.
4. Flip GPT partition 5 to the verified slot.
5. Append `<sha> <version> <build>` to `/data/update/history`, write trial state
   to `/data/update/state` and flush.
6. Delete the applied payload, flush and reboot. A read-only payload volume is
   temporarily remounted writable and then restored to read-only.

Before the GPT flip, a failed write or verification leaves the active slot
selected. The inactive slot and diagnostic logs may already have changed;
the whole card is not byte-identical to its pre-update state. The running
kernel retains its cached active-slot offsets until reboot.

Only the successfully applied payload is deleted; skipped or rejected files
remain on the card. Cleanup failures are logged without blocking the reboot.
When upgrading from an older updater that leaves its archive behind, confirmation
also removes archives matching the current trial's exact image hash, target,
version and build. This one-time compatibility cleanup does not scan on later
confirmed boots and does not delete unrelated skipped payloads.
History is recorded at commit, so a payload left behind or copied back is not
reapplied after rollback. The old `committed-sha` file is read
only to seed history on migration. Diagnostics, including confirmation, use
`baseos-boot.log`; see [boot I/O](10-boot-io-audit.md).

## 5. Trial and rollback

`rcS` calls `baseos-update boot-check` before frontend startup. It increments
an open trial's attempt count and flips back on the third boot that reaches
this check without prior confirmation. `frontend-session` confirms the trial
on session start, even without an installed frontend, then removes trial state.
Charging-only sessions do not reach either operation.

Rollback requires userspace to reach `boot-check`. It cannot recover a rootfs
that fails before that point. Manual slot switching is available through
`gptslot /dev/mmcblk0 flip` when the system can boot.

`gptslot` derives both slot extents from GPT and refuses incompatible layouts.
It writes backup entries/header and fsyncs them, then writes primary
entries/header and fsyncs again. Power loss during the primary GPT write can
still leave inconsistent metadata; the sequence is not an atomic transaction.

## 6. Build and validation

```sh
./build-image.sh rg40xxv
./build-update.sh rg40xxv
```

The payload filename uses `VERSION`; build identity comes from
`git describe --always --dirty`. The builder checks both values against the
rootfs before packaging.

- `tests/test-gpt-slot.sh`: layout, slot arithmetic, flips and invalid geometry.
- `tests/test-update-apply.sh`: selection, rejection, integrity and trial behavior.
- `test-update-roundtrip.sh <target>`: real payload application to a copied image.

Hardware validation covers RG40XX V slot switching, `/data` persistence and
trial confirmation. Failed-trial rollback and Windows volume visibility need
separate hardware checks; see [validation coverage](06-status-and-lessons.md).
